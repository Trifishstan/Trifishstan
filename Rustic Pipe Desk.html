                    <h1>Why is this desk needed?</h1>

                    <p>This desk is needed because my current desk is made of cheap materials, is uncomfortable to use, and does not meet all my needs for a desk.</p>

                    <p>
                        My current desk is made of cheap materials but they put a high price tag on it of like $400-450. Because of the cheap materials it has led to desk 
                        to start easily falling apart. The desk is uncomfortable because the shape of it is an L shape, so my arm and chair keep hitting the other side of the L, 
                        making the desk feel very small. the desk is also quite too tall for my height making it mess up my posture when typing. While my current desk does have 
                        lots of space for storage, the main top of the desk is often cluttered, because there is not enough room elsewhere for specific items I want to keep at my desk.

                    <h1>How does this desk solve the problems of the old desk?</h1>

                    <p>This new desk will be made of sturdy iron and wood with solid connections so that it can still easily come apart. It will not be made of cheap particle board 
                        covered with paper to make it look expensive. Since it will be designed and built by me I will be able to directly control the materials used, and the storage options for the desk.</p>

                    <p>With being able to directly control the style of the desk, I will also be able to ensure that the desk is the proper height to help fix my posture.

                        <h1>Whats are the goals of this desk?</h1>
    
                        <p>This desk needs to achieve a few things in order to be a suitable replacement for my current desk. Firstly, it needs to be sturdy, 
                            because if the desk is not stable and wobbles around, then it won't be a good desk. Secondly, the desk needs to stand the test of time, 
                            meaning it needs to last and not fall apart; this shouldn't be a problem, however. The desk will be made of much stronger and higher 
                            quality than paper-wrapped wood chips.</p>
    
                        <p>Third, this desk should provide storage options for everything I wish to keep stored at my desk. Finally, this desk needed to try and 
                            stay in the price range of $150-$250. These are all the goals I originally set for this desk to be a success. I will later elaborate on 
                            how one of them might have affected the other goals.</p>
                            
                    </div>

                    <div class="row-start">
                        <div class="Grid1-content-wrapper">
                        
                            <h1>How I met the goals for this desk.</h1>
        
                            <p>The way I went about achieving the goals for this desk was to look at other desk designs that use a system of iron and steel plumbing 
                                pipes for their structure and a sheet of solid wood or engineered wood for their tops. This can create a sturdy desk if the correct 
                                supports are taken into consideration. Engineered wood can mean anything from the reliable sturdyness of layed plywood to the estetic 
                                nature of butcher block to the cheap partical board that my cheap desk is made out of. For the top of this desk, I want to go with the 
                                aesthetic nature of butcher block since I like the look of it.Butcher block is also quite sturdy since it is real wood that's been glued together to make a larger board; this creates a more stable 
                                sheet and is significantly cheaper than if the sheet were made of one solid sheet of wood, since wood likes to expand and contract.</p>
        
                            <p>Now, because of the price range I set for the desk, I had to make some compromises on what I was wanting from the desk in order to try and stay below the maximum price point. However, even with cutting down on the size of the desk as much as I could, I was still only able to get it down to around $275 for the desk. In the end, I am still happy with this desk design; it meets most of my needs for a desk and is still close to the price point. Best of all, it can be upgraded with more pipe and wood at any point to meet more of the needs for my desk since everything is easily obtainable from local hardwear stores. </p>
