                    <p>The Trans Am 20000 WR more commenly just called the Trans Am, is a fictional car from the anime Redline.</p>

                    <p>Redline is an anime where we follow Sweet JP and his heavily modified Trans Am. Which is heavily inspired by old school F-body muscle cars from the 1960s early 1970's.</p>

                    <div class="paragraph-indent">
                        <p>Now since the Trans Am was to be made out of cardboard there had to be a few compromises with the detail.</p>

                        <p>Since it is a fictional vehicle and everything is hand drawn, creating this miniature model was quite difficult. This is because since it does not really exist, there are small 
                        inconsistency's within the animation, plus perspectives messing with dimensions and other artistic flair that make everything just look better and smoother. Also folding 
                        cardboard is not the easiest thing to do accurately without being good at origami. This is why I went with a layering method for half of it, but had to do folding for the rest.  </p>

                        <div class="paragraph-indent">
                            <p>In the end I believe the model came out pritty well, I had an enjoyable time creating the model and only burned my hand once with the hotglue gun. </p>
    
                            <p>This is the finished model of Sweet JP's Trans Am, something unique about it is that it is probably the only real model of the trans Am that is 
                                made out of cardboard. It is far from a perfect recreation of the Trans Am, but I am happy with the model even though I had to improvise some 
                                of the details with extra sheets of cardboard because of my terrible origami skills.
