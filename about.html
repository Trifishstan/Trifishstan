                        My name is Tristan Fisher, and I am currently studying to become a CAD Designer at the nearby Davis Technical Collage. I Graduated Farmingtion High school in 2021,
                    I have worked at a few part-time jobs, all of which have either been completely unenjoyable or simply just work. 
                    Some hobbies other than just CAD Design in my free time, include things such as woodworking, photo editing, Coding (sometimes I hate coding), 3D printing, 
                    but my most guilty hobby is playing video games, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite.

                        Some CAD models I have done for personal use, learning, and for fun, includes a wooden puzzle cube I made in my CAD design class in high school. 
                    And a Power Box container to hold a power supply, wires, a ESP32, and an inferred sensor, for my LED lights in my room. 
                    I also started working on a design for a mini Juggernaut fridge from COD, that one is not finished yet.
