                    <h1>What is a Cube?</h1>

                    <p>Before we can understand what a Puzzle Cube is we must understand the "Cube."  </p>

                    <div class="paragraph-indent">
                        <p>The Cube is more than just a geometric shape. It is a three-dimensional object, <strong>Bounded</strong> by its six square faces, with three meeting at any given vertex or corner. The Cube has the greatest volume contained per surface area. </p>
                        <p>Since the Cube is a three-dimensional object it makes for a great puzzle, so lets cut it up into five completely different pieces.</p>

                    <h1>When the Cube?</h1>

                    <div class="paragraph-indent">
                        <p>The Puzzle Cube was created as an assinmnet for my High school CAD Design class. It first started out as a drawning in my Engineering Design book.</p>
                        <p>Then once the the Puzzle cube was all planned out each of the five pieces where fully drawn, then each of the seperate pieces were modeled in Inventor as their own files. Then I took all the piece files and moved into one file and put the cube together.</p>

                        <p>Well here it is the Cube, I called it the Death Cube, I really dont know why I did.</p>
    
                        <p>It is made out of a bunch of smaller wooden Cube's glued together to make each of the puzzle piece's. Should have called it the Cube Cube, much better name. </p>
